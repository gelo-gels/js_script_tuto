    <h1>Lesson 1 Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and
most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow
client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.
JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name
LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in
Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
</p>
<p>The language was developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, which was later renamed to LiveScript. The
change of the name from LiveScript to JavaScript, was roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java Technology in
its Netscape Navigator web browser. The language’s name is the result of a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun, in
exchange for Netscape bundling Sun’s Java runtime with their then-dominant browser. It was first introduced and deployed in
the Netscape borwser version 2.0B in December. Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for Standardization
resulting in the standardized version named ECMAScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript and Java are two completely different languages; however, both are influenced by the C language. The difference
between JavaScript and Java is that with JavaScript, common people that are not into programming find it easier to deal with.
</p>
<ul>
<h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
<li>Learn what JavaScript is
and what it can do</li>
<li>Learn its features and
disadvantages
</li></ul>
  </div>
    <ul>
<h3>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
</h3>
      <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
      <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
      <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
      <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
</li>
      <li>Open and cross-platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Client-Side JavaScript </h3>
      <p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML
document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser,
and dynamically create HTML content.</p>
<p>The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might
use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted
to the Web Server.
JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates
explicitly or implicitly.</p> 
  <h3>What Can JavaScript Do? </h3>
  <ul><h3>Some of the things that JavaScript can do are:</h3>
  <li>JavaScript can react to event (mouse click, and pre-loading for webpage can lead to executing codes written in
JavaScript)</li>
  <li>JavaScript can be used to validate data (forms that requires user input, instead of using server-side scripting, it can be
used to validate and processing time)</li>
  <li>JavaScript can be used to create cookies (used to save or retrieved information from a visitor’s computer)</li>
  <li>JavaScript can enhance a web page (can be used to add items such as pop-up window box, animation or dynamic
images, menu from a drop down box)
</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Advantages of JavaScript </h1>
  <h3>The merits of using JavaScript are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic,
which means less load on your server</li>
      <li>Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter
something.</li>
      <li>Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates
them via the keyboard.</li>
      <li>Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich
Interface to your site visitors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Limitations of JavaScript </h1>
      <h3>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the
following important features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
</li>
  <li>JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.</li>
  <li>JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.</li>
  <li>Some browsers do not support JavaScript</li>
  <li>Any secret embedded in JavaScript could be extracted by a determined adversary</li>
  <li>JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on
a client computer via the web</li>
  <li>Web site authors can not perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates, because the code is sent to the client
</li>
  <li>Source codes that has been deliberately made hard to understand can be reverse engineered so your codes are still
exposed to possible threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise
static HTML pages</p>
<h1>JavaScript Development Tools </h1>
<p>One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text
editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a
compiler.
To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft FrontPage: Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web
developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.</li>
  <li>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX: Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the
professional web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with </li>
  <li>Macromedia HomeSite 5: HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to
manage personal websites effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where is JavaScript Today</h1>
<p>The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition
5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor. The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can
be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/ Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the
ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.</p>
